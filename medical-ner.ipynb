    "## **Fine-tuning BERT for named-entity recognition**\n",
    "We undertook this project as a learning experience. We aim to explore the working of BERT with the help of PyTorch and fine tune it to classify tokens by wordpiece and achieve custom NER. We have experimented on two datasets with over 100 thousand data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This model has BERT as its base architecture, with a token classification head on top, allowing it to make predictions at the token level, rather than the sequence level. Named entity recognition is typically treated as a token classification problem, so that's what we are going to use it for.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the idea of **transfer learning**, i.e. first pretraining a large neural network in an unsupervised way, and then fine-tuning that neural network on a task of interest. In this case, BERT is a neural network pretrained on 2 tasks: masked language modeling and next sentence prediction. Now, we are going to fine-tune this network on a NER dataset. Fine-tuning is supervised learning, so this means we will need a labeled dataset.\n",

    "#### **Downloading and preprocessing the data**\n",
    "Named entity recognition (NER) uses a specific annotation scheme, which is defined (at least for European languages) at the *word* level. An annotation scheme that is widely used is called **[IOB-tagging](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inside%E2%80%93outside%E2%80%93beginning_(tagging)**, which stands for Inside-Outside-Beginning. Each tag indicates whether the corresponding word is *inside*, *outside* or at the *beginning* of a specific named entity. The reason this is used is because named entities usually comprise more than 1 word.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's have a look at an example. If you have a sentence like \"Barack Obama was born in Hawaï\", then the corresponding tags would be   [B-PERS, I-PERS, O, O, O, B-GEO]. B-PERS means that the word \"Barack\" is the beginning of a person, I-PERS means that the word \"Obama\" is inside a person, \"O\" means that the word \"was\" is outside a named entity, and so on. So one typically has as many tags as there are words in a sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we will use a NER dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/namanj27/ner-dataset) that is already in IOB format. One has to go to this web page, download the dataset, unzip it, and upload the csv file to this notebook. Let's print out the first few rows of this csv file:"

    "A tricky part of NER with BERT is that BERT relies on **wordpiece tokenization**, rather than word tokenization. This means that we should also define the labels at the wordpiece-level, rather than the word-level!\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you have word like \"Washington\" which is labeled as \"b-gpe\", but it gets tokenized to \"Wash\", \"##ing\", \"##ton\", then one approach could be to handle this by only train the model on the tag labels for the first word piece token of a word (i.e. only label \"Wash\" with \"b-gpe\"). This is what was done in the original BERT paper, see Github discussion [here](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/issues/64#issuecomment-443703063).\n",

    "\n",
    "Below, we define a regular PyTorch [dataset class](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/data.html) (which transforms examples of a dataframe to PyTorch tensors). Here, each sentence gets tokenized, the special tokens that BERT expects are added, the tokens are padded or truncated based on the max length of the model, the attention mask is created and the labels are created based on the dictionary which we defined above. Word pieces that should be ignored have a label of -100 (which is the default `ignore_index` of PyTorch's [CrossEntropyLoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.CrossEntropyLoss.html)).\n",
